# In development

# Start

The project will aim to completely replace all the electronics, leaving the original PSU, BED and head components.
 
 Some components will be mandatory and others can be replaced with what you prefer based on your needs.

## Components:

-  [FPC Brackout 30p 1mm](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oCeUnud) Bed wiring
-  [FPC Brackout 40p 0.5mm](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oB8gCY1) LCD Wiring (Coming soon)
